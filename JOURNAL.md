## 10/21/2025 - Learning Onshape  

It's Day 1 of Blueprint for me, and I’ve been following some YouTube tutorials on how to use Onshape. Once I’m comfortable with the software (probably in 2 days or so) I will start designing my hexapod. Since I don’t have any of the components yet, I’ll copy measurements (and take a lot of inspiration) from open source projects so I don’t run into issues after printing my parts.![Screenshot 2025-10-21 232610.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDI4NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--95b7541d95ece8a2d051ec4d87090fa09261251b/Screenshot%202025-10-21%20232610.png)

  

## 10/22/2025 - Learning Onshape  

Day 2 of Blueprint. Today I imported a 3D model of an open source hexapod (yt: @MakeYourPet) and tried to remake the parts and assemble them. Everything went horribly wrong. I still have a lot to learn about Onshape, and this 3D model is going to take way longer than I expected. Tmr I might take a break from CAD and do some research on the electronics. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDYyNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--426b7632d65d899d35ab735de5f51bfb80c6a1dc/image.png)  

## 10/23/2025 - Some Research   

Day 3 of Blueprint. Today i did a little bit of cad (like 10 mins) but i mainly did research on the electronics and everything. im planing on making it an rc hexapod first using an arduino and then later depending on how much time and money i have im planing on adding a rasbery pie and camera to make it somewhat autonomus and also make the auto aim turret attachment for its head. for the rc version im planing on adding a lidar sensor but not sure if i can fit that in the budget so i might just go with 4 ultrasonic sensors facing different directions for obstacle avoidance. right now im not sure if i should make the rc version with the arduino first and then add a rasbery pie later, or just make the rc version using a rasbery pie so i have to do less wiring later on and prob wont have problems with the frame and stuff. but i think if i try to make the rc version with just a rasbery pie it’ll be much harder than making it with arduino so im not sure. for the autonomous part my main goal is for it to follow a specific object once it locks on, then just follow it and aim with its auto aiming turret and hit all its shots even in long range by calculating the object’s speed, its own speed, the direction each one of them is moving, and the bullet travel speed. ill try to get it as accurate as possible since its one of the features im looking forward to the most. the top turret will be an attachment so it might have its own battery and everything else, oh and ill add an imu sensor so the hexapod can walk on slopes and balance itself. i actually have a lot of stuff planned for this hexapod robot, not sure how many of them i can add but ill try my best. really excited about this. and im planing on printing the parts with PETG and maybe use TPU for the feet. I will make a google doc with all the features I want and all the steps so its ezier to keep track of things.  ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTAwMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b354f2257457c09fdf9325eb99fb46542bfa9436/image.png)

  

## 10/25/2025 - Making a spreadsheet for the parts   

Its Day 4 of Blueprint. I decided to use a raspberry pi for my hexapod and picked out some of the parts I need to build my hexapod. Im comparing the prices between amazon, aliexpress, alibaba and some other sites for each componets. The servos are stupidly expensive not sure how im going to pull this off but I might be able to get them for cheaper if I buy in bulk since my friend is also making a hexapod and we can use the same servos. I decided to use a 7.4 vold lipo battery to power my servos and I will prob use a diff battery to power the rasbery pie. And I have a sg90 servo which I will use to turn my camera left and right. I might add a speaker and a mic to my hexapod too. And the jumper wires i have might to be thick enough so I might have to get new wires for this project. tmr ill do some research on how I can build my turrent and pick out the parts for that. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTYxOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--121d6c59533929202a0addb091979020dc0f441b/image.png)
  

## 10/27/2025 - Tried to assemble a leg + research on the turret   

Its day 5 of Blueprint. Today wasnt a productive day, as I only worked for about 2 hours and I wasnt even able to assemble one of the legs for my hexapod on onshape. My brain has been blanking and I seem to have forgotten a lot of the stuff I learned in onshape I barely have half a leg done. But I was able to do some research for the turret. Im planing on getting a small gel blaster, ripping out its insides and then making a custom 3d printed shell so I can mount it on my hexapod. I might also add a lazer cause it looks cool. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjEzMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d4f5294de402eeb2d427ac0e7828f630352a5019/image.png)
  

## 11/1/2025 - Tried to assemble the parts on Onshape  

Its Day 6 of blueprint. The 3d model is not working out for me. I was able to get 3 of the legs set up on Onshape. I have to flip them so It fits on the left side, I DONT KNOW WHATS WRONG, IT JUST WONT FLIP. I TRIED TO MIRROR THE PARTS FOR 30 MINUTES AND ITS JUST NOT WORKING. Im done with the 3d model. I will just focus on the parts list and wiring and ship my project for the grant. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzYzNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8532a492158f8f5b70cdbe5825d919b9a1d60a35/image.png)
