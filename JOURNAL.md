## 10/21/2025 - Learning Onshape  

It's Day 1 of Blueprint for me, and I’ve been following some YouTube tutorials on how to use Onshape. Once I’m comfortable with the software (probably in 2 days or so) I will start designing my hexapod. Since I don’t have any of the components yet, I’ll copy measurements (and take a lot of inspiration) from open source projects so I don’t run into issues after printing my parts.![Screenshot 2025-10-21 232610.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDI4NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--95b7541d95ece8a2d051ec4d87090fa09261251b/Screenshot%202025-10-21%20232610.png)
